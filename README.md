This is a jsPsych program created to test creativity prevalence in Jan 2020.

It has been edited from its original form to remove study-specific details.

<ul>This program was created using jQuery, jsPsych, and PHP to meet the following specifications: 
  <li>Assign participants to control or experimental groups</li>
  <li>Obtain participant consent</li>
  <li>Present detailed task instructions</li>
  <li>Run participants through 5 blocks of a number of trials with short breaks in between</li>
  <li>Administer study-related surveys</li>
  <li>Obtain participant demographic information</li>
  <li>Present debriefing information</li>
  <li>Save data as .csv files and add participant ids to a running participant list</li>
  <li>Return assigned verification code</li>
 </ul>
 
 <ul>The test program was programmed as follows:
  <li>Each trial consisted of an image presented in the center of the screen for 500ms</li>
  <li>Participants rated each image as being either creative (signal) or not creative (noise)</li>
  <li>In the control group, all blocks contained the same ratio of signal to noise</li>
  <li>In the experiment group, the ratio of signal to noise decreased</li>
  <li>Elapsed time, trial number, signal rate, and stimulus creativity scores were recorded, among other variables</li>
</ul>

This program was created based on code written by David Levari for use in general prevalence experiments. Therefore this code cannot be used, in part or in full, without permission from both authors. Please refer to the code itself for contact information if desired.
